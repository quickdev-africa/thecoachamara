This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## CI smoke tests and migrations

This repo contains a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/smoke-test.yml` which runs an integration smoke test on pull requests when the following secrets are configured in the repository settings:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (optional; if set the workflow will apply SQL files from `supabase/migrations` using `psql`)
- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` (optional; used to initialize Paystack during funnel create if provided)

If secrets are not present the workflow will skip the smoke tests to keep PRs from forks from failing.

CI notes
--------
To enable the CI smoke job (`.github/workflows/ci-smoke-and-env-safety.yml`) you'll need to add the following repository secrets in GitHub:

- `STAGING_BASE_URL` — the URL of a staging deployment to run the smoke test against (e.g. https://staging.example.com)
- `SMOKE_TEST_TOKEN` — short-lived token that the staging server recognizes for simulate verify (keep secret)

The CI job will run env-safety, build, and smoke test after changes are pushed to `main`.
